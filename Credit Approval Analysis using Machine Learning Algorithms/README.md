1) Self Implemented Codes:
a) Naive Bayes
NB_AML2.py:
NOTE: The program is python 2.7 compatible. Kindly run on compatible python version to avoid incorrect results/errors.

This is the Naive Bayes Code:
Please run this file with the following command:
	python NB_AML2.py data_file, delimiter, header_present_flag, label_index, fraction

Example:
 	python NB_AML2.py "default of credit card clients_no_headers.csv" "," False 15 0.1

The parameters for all the 3 datasets are given below

It takes 5 parameters as follows:

1) data_file = The data file name (with the full path if the file is not in the same folder as the python file)
 	eg: "default of credit card clients_no_headers.csv"

2) delimiter = The delimiter used to separate the columns in the data (Can be "," or blankspace(" ") or anything else
as long as its consistent through out the file)
 	eg: ","

3) header_present_flag = True/False.Used to notify whether the data file contains the first row as column header or not
 	eg: False

4) label_index = Need to give the index of the label column. (0,1,2....
   NOTE: Index starts at 0 and NOT 1 !!!
	eg: 15

5) fraction: The fraction (should be always between 0 and 1) in which the data needs to be divided as training and test.
    Eg: If 0.9 is given, then it randomly assigns 90% of the data as train and rest 10% as test.
 		eg: 0.9

Note: Please make sure you give data_file and header_present_flag in double quotes ("") and NOT single quotes ('')

Parameters:
1) German Data Set (german.data)
	data_file = "german.data"
	delimiter = " " (Blank Space)
	header_present_flag = False
	Label Index = 20
	fraction = 0.9 (Can be changed to anything between 0 and 1)

2) CRX Data Set
	data_file = "crx.data"
	delimiter = "," (Comma)
	header_present_flag = False
	Label Index = 15
	fraction = 0.9 (Can be changed to anything between 0 and 1)

3) Default Data Set
	data_file = "default of credit card clients.csv"
	delimiter = "," (Comma)
	header_present_flag = True
	Label Index = 23
	fraction = 0.9 (Can be changed to anything between 0 and 1)




b) Self implemented kNN is present in the below python files itself

2) Scikit based implementation:
Self implemented kNN is present in the below python files itself

NOTE: The below python programs is python 3.5 compatible. Kindly run on compatible python version to avoid incorrect results/errors.
Python version: 3.5
Individual Dataset Analysis and Parameters Tuning:
One python file per dataset
a) German.py
b) CRX.py, 
c) Default.py

Please run the above 3 files separately (having all data files in the same folder). These files contains the best parameters tuning by greedy approach for all three datasets.

Outputs for this is 10 Fold Cross Validation ROC graph and accuracy, and are stored in the below files respectively:
a) German.html
b) CRX.html
c) Default.html

The results of respective datasets is displayed as jupyter notebook in these files.

Note: For Default.py our kNN implementations takes a long time, due to large data.


Best Parameters settings and Confusion Matrix:
Python version: 3.5

d) final.py
Please run final.py (having all data files in the same folder). 
This file contains the best parameters settings by greedy approach for all three datasets.
Outputs for this is 10 Fold Cross Validation ROC graph, accuracy and Confusion Matrix, and are stored in the below files respectively:

d) final.html = The results of final.py is displayed as jupyter notebook in this file.
