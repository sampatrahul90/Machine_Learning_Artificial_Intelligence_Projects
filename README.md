a) Image Orientation Classifier with Mountain Ridge Detector - Monte Carlo-Markov Chain

b) 15 - Puzzle Solver with edge swap functionality - A* with a modified Manhattan distance for edge swap functionality

c) N Queens/Rooks puzzle using Search algorithms

d) AI player for Tetris

e) Reverse Tic Tac Toe Game - Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning with a hand-tuned utility function

f) Email Spam Classifier - Naive Bayes and Decision Tree

g) Document Topic Classifier - Naive Bayes with Expectation Maximization

h) GPS Route Finder - BFS, DFS, IDS, A*

i) Credit Approval Analysis using Machine Learning Algorithms - Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and kNN
